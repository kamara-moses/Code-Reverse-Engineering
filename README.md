![Passport Authentication Demo]()

## Description
This project is a walk through of a codebase that the user can use to create a new project with NPM, Node, Passport, Sequelize and MySQL
    - The codebase that is being reverse engineered is a passport authentication application. The user is able to sign up for the website and after signing up, they can then login to their account using the their email and password they created in the sign up process.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Installation- Go to the my GitHub page https://github.com/kamara-moses/Reverse-Engineering-Code. Locate the green code button to the right of the page. Click the code button and click the clipboard to copy the repo url. Navigate to your terminal or bash and cd into the directory that you would like to clone the repo to. Once you have cd into the directory, type git clone and paste the url you copied from the github page. Press enter and you have successfully cloned the repo into your local machine.

 Install dependency packages using npm i, this install the dependencies you would need to run the app. If a dependency did not get installed, type npm i and the name of the dependency you need to make the app work. 


## Usage
ONce you have all the dependencies installed and saved everything inside your directory. Type node server inside your terminal to start the server. Once the server is started go to the link that was inside of your server.js file to see the app run.

## Challenges
My only challenge with this project was the fact that I have never had to reverse engineer code before, giving a walk through of the code and it functionality was a first. It definitely made understanding the code easier, because am able to explain each part of the code that works collectively with all the other parts.
